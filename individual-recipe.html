        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>Additional butter or oil for cooking</li>
            <!-- Add more ingredients as needed -->
        </ul>

        <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
        <p>Step 1: Prepare the Dry Ingredients:
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</p>
        <p>Step 2: Mix the Wet Ingredients:
In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and melted butter.</p>
        <p>Step 3: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:
Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined. It's okay if the batter is a bit lumpy; overmixing can make the pancakes less fluffy.</p>
        <p>Step 4: Preheat the Griddle or Pan:
Heat a griddle or non-stick pan over medium heat. Add a small amount of butter or oil to coat the surface.</p>
        <p>Step 5: Pour the Batter:
For each pancake, ladle 1/4 to 1/3 cup of batter onto the hot griddle. Use the back of the ladle to spread the batter into a round shape.</p>
        <p>Step 6: Cook the Pancakes:
Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake and the edges start to look set. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes.</p>
        <p>Step 7: Flip the Pancakes:
Once the bubbles have formed and the edges are set, carefully flip the pancakes using a spatula. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown on the other side.</p>
        <p>Step 8: Serve:
Remove the pancakes from the griddle and place them on a serving plate. Repeat the process with the remaining batter.</p>
